# Introduction {#foundations}

To start your journey in mastering R, in the following six chapters you'll learn what I consider to the be foundational components of R:

1.  In [Names and values](#names-values), you'll learn about of the most 
    important distinctions you haven't previously needed to grapple with:
    the difference between an object and its name. Improving your mental model 
    here will help you make better predictions about when R will copy data 
    and hence which basic operations are cheap and which are expensive.
   
1.  You have already used many R data structures, so in [Vectors] you'll 
    dive into the details, learning how the different types of vector 
    fit together and . You'll also learn about attributes, which allow you to
    store arbitrary metadata, and form the basis for two of R's object
    oriented programming toolkits
    
1.  To write concise and performance R code it is important to fully appreciate
    the power of subsetting with `[`, `[[` and `$`, as described in [Subsetting].
    Understanding the fundamental components of subsetting will allow you to
    solve new problems by combining the building blocks in novel ways.
    
1.  Functions are the most important building block of R code. [Functions]
    will help you to understand exactly how functions work, including
    the __scoping__ rules, which govern how R looks up values from names.
    
1.  In [Environments], you'll learn about one of the foundational elements of R
    that you're least likely to be familiar with as an R user: environments. 
    Environments are the data structure that binds names to values, and they
    power tools like package namespaces. Unlike most programming languages,
    environments in R are "first class" which means that you can manipulate
    them just like other objects.

1.  [Conditions] concludes this section of the book with a discussion of 
    "conditions", the umbrella term used to describe errors, warnings, and 
    messages. You've certainly encountered these before, so in this chapter
    you learn how to signal them appropriately in your own functions, and how 
    to handle them when signalled elsewhere.
